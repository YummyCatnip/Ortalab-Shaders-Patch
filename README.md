# What is this?
An edit of Ortalab's custom shaders so the mod can run on mobile using the APK from [Balatro Mobile Maker](https://github.com/blake502/balatro-mobile-maker).

The method of install the mod on android is as follows [Lovely / Steamodded 1.0 mods on Android #137
](https://github.com/blake502/balatro-mobile-maker/issues/137).

It should also work on PC without problems, but I still recommend the original for it: [Ortalab Mod](https://github.com/Eremel/Ortalab).

# How to Install the patch

Simply replace the original shaders files in the modÂ´s folder with these ones.
